notes:
  "As an English writer, Adalbert of Spalding is a ghost created by Bale out of
  Leland's recording a copy of the *Speculum Gregorii* at Spalding. The compiler
  of this common text was Adalbert of Metz († *c*980; *CMA Gallia*, 1. 13–15).
  Kirkstead, K53, did not make the author an Englishman. Bale, *Index*, 2–3,
  refers to two copies in private hands besides those recorded at Bury and 
  Spalding by Kirkstead."
